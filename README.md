The keyword extraction technique will sift through the whole set of data in minutes and obtain the words and phrases that best describe each subject. This way, you can easily identify which parts of the available data cover the subjects you are looking for while saving your teams many hours of manual processing.

# Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is an essential step in building a Machine Learning model and depending on how well the data has been preprocessed; the results are seen.

In NLP, text preprocessing is the first step in the process of building a model.

The various text preprocessing steps are:

Tokenization
Lower casing
Stop words removal
Stemming
Lemmatization
These various text preprocessing steps are widely used for dimensionality reduction.
